# Expect

The `@japa/expect` plugin is a wrapper on top of [jest-expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect). Please read the Jest documentation to view the methods available on the `expect` object.

Suppose you have not configured the plugin during the initial setup. Then, you can install it from the npm registry as follows.

```sh
npm i -D @japa/expect@2.0.2
```

And register it as a plugin within the `bin/test.js` file.

```ts
// title: ESM
// highlight-start
import { expect } from '@japa/expect'
// highlight-end
import { configure, processCliArgs } from '@japa/runner'

configure({
  ...processCliArgs(process.argv.slice(2)),
  ...{
    files: ['tests/**/*.spec.js'],
    // highlight-start
    plugins: [expect()]
    // highlight-end
  }
})
```

```ts
// title: CommonJS
// highlight-start
const { expect } = require('@japa/expect')
// highlight-end
const { configure, processCliArgs } = require('@japa/runner')

configure({
  ...processCliArgs(process.argv.slice(2)),
  ...{
    files: ['tests/**/*.spec.js'],
    // highlight-start
    plugins: [expect()]
    // highlight-end
  }
})
```

Once done. You can access the `expect` property from the [Test context](../test-context.md) as follows.

```ts
test('add two numbers', ({ expect }) => {
  expect(2 + 2).toEqual(4)
})
```

In Jest, the `expect` property is available globally. However, with Japa, we recommend you always read it from the Test context. If you're getting an error saying `expect` is not available from `TestContext`, make sure you included the bin folder in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "include": ["bin", "src", "tests"]
}
```
